            Hello and thank you for the interest in this new website. I have live in this neighborhood, Hudson Manor, for many years. As an older neighborhood which has flood irrigation, we enjoy more older growth trees and foliage than
            most other neighborhoods in the Sonoran Desert climate. As a result, our neighborhood is home to a higher than average density of birds, including some species which are rarely seen in the Sonoran Desert, as well as endemic
            species. I have become a bird watcher over the years and I decided to start a website so that I can share images of birds I've seen, as well as give an opportunity to members of the neighborhood to share theirs. Please browse
            the website, and if you would like to, interact and contribute. Thanks.
            <br />
